I do not ask for money here. I just want to share my story with the world here. \n\nMy family and I are victims of the faulty centralized world.\n\nI come from an Asian developing country. I am a desperate son of an innocent and hopeless father who is under persecution from the local authority.\n\nNot a long time ago, a disaster happened to my family. My father, a principled and innocent man of integrity, is convicted for the crimes that he never commits and is punished severely for his fight against injustice. It is a deliberate miscarriage of justice and deliberate persecution by the local authority.\n\nDuring the \"investigation\", the local investigators tortured my father for months, using illegal measures such as complete isolation, mind control methods (including various abuses, fabricated news about family members being tortured, threats to harm the family), enforcing him to get sick by worsening the living environment, and imposing sleep deprivation. In the court, the validity and authenticity of the fabricated evidence are not considered and the illegal investigation process is completely ignored. The court is just a formality, not about justice.\n\nAs my father is determined to never surrender, the local authority decides to \"show no mercy\" and destroy my father completely. The penalty given to my father is severe. They set up a very high forfeit to make my family financially vulnerable to survive, leaving alone to protect ourselves and afford helpful lawyers. Besides, I am prepared for not seeing my father for a decade, due to the long sentence.\n\nBad people drive out good. My father and my family are the victims of the in-transparent and corrupted centralized system in the city we live in. We are not alone. There are similar tragedies and broken families buried, away from the public. Only some of them can be righted via endless hard efforts of tears and pains.\n\nIn my country, few understand what happens to my father and my family, as most of them only believe in the centralized authority. On the other hand, most public servants who know the truth in the local centralized system are silent and indifferent. Those who know the truth are simply watching. We have almost no local support. I am so desperate and hopeless.  Though nothing can be done, there are some nice people showing care to us. We really appreciate it.\n\nI am a patriot and I love my country. I believe justice will come. I have been working hard and I will save him by myself. I will try out whatever I can, no matter how small the possibility is.\n\nDecentralization will bring real change one day. I hope there will be fewer victims suffering from the in-transparency and manipulation of the faulty centralized system. No more people separated from their beloved father/mother due to injustice. \n\nLets make it right.", "blockHash": "0x59865e565b37f670e27258db0194613376f01873e4b5f612c7c12c162b7ecc3f", "blockNumber": 13005337}, {"hash": "0xa5371eda3e56a614cdecc2b875f4236c7651e8ab3822f798b108e14b2659aaaa", "timestamp": 1628705157, "address": "0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963", "message": "DISCLAIMER: I HAVE NEVER ASKED FOR BOUNTY FROM POLY NETWORK\nWHAT I HAVE SAID IS ON THE CHAINS\n", "blockHash": "0x2f9d46aec802152d59fbca982e8d0528de6ebdc1598763cfdb2976aec6826ef3", "blockNumber": 13005391}, {"hash": "0x579fe88d2934d2ee7ce002fa2c6a1c72409ff02452b756bee22167967947bfb0", "timestamp": 1628705263, "address": "0x71Eab088EC907e8D8457d2c0Fd7B40B78374C574", "message": "\u6280\u672f\u5927\u795e\uff0c\u6211\u524d\u4e24\u5929\u521a\u88ab\u9ed1\u5ba2\u76d7\u4e86\u5168\u90e8\u8eab\u5bb6\uff0c\u4ef7\u503c100\uff37\u7f8e\u91d1\u7684ETH\uff0c\u73b0\u5728\u5206\u65e0\u5206\u6587\uff0c\u53ef\u4ee5\u6551\u6d4e\u4e00\u4e0b\u6211\u5417\uff0c\u5341\u5206\u611f\u8c22\n\nGod of technology, I was stolen by hackers two days ago, all of my net worth, worth 1 million US dollars of ETH, now there is no penny, can you help me, thank you very much", "blockHash": "0xd1261e942b22b0bf3a16806a382f80e8fd36b0a58863a608fdb1e907ae559bb4", "blockNumber": 13005401}, {"hash": "0x94836b01676a63f1857f8983d2442b4d1cc48987f7e11f36e1588dc088ec78b8", "timestamp": 1628705900, "address": "0x277B652F157E3101f64eF59F03D868EC01ea8b32", "message": "Thanks for your answers, it helped to understand your motivation and the situation in general, since the Poly Team does not provide any details of what happened.

(LEAKING IDENTITY 1) I JUST EXPRESSED MY TRUE FEELINGS WITHOUT POLISHING. TYPING WHILE HOLDING THE \"SHIFT\" IS NOT EASY.\n\nQ: BLACK HAT OR WHITE HAT?\nA: I ALSO ENJOY THE FEELING OF SUPERIORITY BY JUDGING OTHERS, BUT IT'S NEVER EASY. NOT ONLY LAWFUL GOOD CAN BE THE WHITE HAT. SO CALLED BLACK HAT CAN ALSO BE A NICE GUY. PEOPLE ARE VARIABLE. HAVE YOU HEARD OF GRAYSCALE?\n\nQ: SHOULDN'T A WHITE HAT JUST NOTIFY THE DEVS?\nA: READ P1Q1234. DEFI IS A DARK FOREST, HUNDREDS OF PROJECTS RAN AWAY EVERY YEAR. I DONT TRUST ANYONE.\n\nQ: WHY HIDING AT THE BEGINNING?\nA: YOU MIGHT BE IN DANGER FOR ANY REASON EVEN IF YOU ARE LAWFUL GOOD. SECURITY GUYS DO CARE ABOUT SECURITY.\n\nQ: WHY EXPLAIN SO MUCH?\nA: READ P4Q2. THE GUIDING PART MEANS A LOT TO ME. I WOULD LIKE TO SHARE HOW I PWNED MY MIND TO OVERCOME THE ARROGANT AND GREED. I THINK THE MENTAL CHALLENGE IS NOT EASIER THAN THE HACKING PART.\n\nTO BE HONEST, I WAS SO EXCITED WHEN THE EXPOLIT WORKED THAT I ALMOST FORGOT MY ORIGINAL PLAN, BECAUSE THERE WAS TOO MUCH GUESSING AND IT'S UNEXPECTED (SEE P2Q1). THE FIRST MESSAGE(SEE P3Q1) SPARKED MY INTEREST IN DOING SOME CREATIVE THINGS. I SPENT SOME TIME LOOKING FOR FUNNY BUT RATIONAL IDEAS FROM MY MESSAGE LIST.\n\nI AM (STILL) STRONGLY CONFIDENT ABOUT MY HIDING, SO I THINK I CAN HANDLE THE GAME AS LONG AS I DONT CAUSE UNAFFORDABLE LOSS. LATER I STARTED TO CALM DOWN BECAUSE OF THOSE REFUGEES. YES, I REALIZED THAT EVEN TAKING OVER THE MONEY TEMPORARILY IS STILL AN UNFORGIVEN JOKE, IT'S CAUSING TOO MUCH PAIN.\n\nFOR THE \"ONE BILLION SHITCOIN\" JOKE, I MEANT THE HEADLINE OF THIS INCIDENT COULD BE MORE EYECATCHING, BUT THE ENDING WOULD BE THE SAME: I WOULD NOT DUMP THE SHITCOINS. IT TURNED OUT TO BE A TERRIBLE JOKE. FOR THE \"DAO\" JOKE, I WAS ASKING THE COMMUNITY HOW AND WHEN TO REFUND. IT WAS A IRRESPONSIBLE JOKE.\n\nI WAS NOT TERRIFIED BECAUSE OF EXPOSURE OR LAUNDERING TROUBLE AT ALL (READ MY NOOB LESSONS). I JUST REALIZED I SHOULD BE CAUTIOUS BECAUSE MY DECISION WOULD CHANGE THE LIVES OF MANY PEOPLE! IF I LEFT TOKENS THERE AND QUIT THE GAME, I COULD ENJOY THE LIFE OF BEING A MILLIONAIRE AND CONTINUE MY EXPLORATION AS USUAL, BUT THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WOULD LOSE CONTROL OF THEIR FATE. THIS IS AGAINST MY PERSONAL PHILOSOPHY (SEE P4Q2).\n\n_SOON_ I WROTE AN _EMAIL_ TO THE POLY ATTACHING A SIGNED ETH TRANSACTION FROM AN ANONYMOUS MAILBOX. IF THEY HAD GOT THE MAIL, THEY WOULD BE ABLE TO BROADCAST A TRANSACTION FROM MY ADDRESS. THIS WAS NOT A WISE MOVE, SINCE I CAN NOT BROADCAST ANY NEW MESSAGE BEFORE THEM. THAT MAIL MUST BE LOST, I WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED FROM THE ETH, BUT I WAITED A FEW HOURS BECAUSE OF THAT MISTAKE.\n\nTHE NEXT PART OF THE STORY IS WHAT YOU ALREADY KNOW. I STOPPED MY GAME AND RETURNED THE MONEY, AS I PROMISED, AS I PLANNED.\n\nQ: YOU ARE NOT EXPOSED, BUT THEY HAVE GOT THE CLUES, SO YOU ARE TERRIFIED!\nA: I AM MORE CONFIDENT THAN ANY OTHERS.\n\nI AM A HIGH PROFILE HACKER IN THE REAL WORLD (LEAKING IDENTITY 2). I WORK IN THE SECURITY INDUSTRY AND HAVE BEEN DEVOTED TO HACKING CAREER SINCE YOUNG (LEAKING IDENTITY 3). SERIOUSLY, AS SECURITY RESEARCHERS, OUR JOB IS TO SAVE THE HIDDEN WORLD.\n\nI KNOW SECURITY CONSULTING IS A HARD JOB, AND PUBLIC RELATION AND REPUTATION MEAN A LOT. I DON'T MIND SECURITY TEAMS MAKING ADVERTISEMENTS BASED ON MY INCIDENT, ESPECIALLY WHEN IT'S HELPFUL TO THEM. RAISING CONCERNS ABOUT SECURITY IS ALSO THE MISSION OF OUR CAREER.\n\nIF ANY HACKER CAN FIND MY SOCIAL IDENTITY IN ONE MONTH, I WOULD LIKE TO SEND HIM MY PERSONAL GIFT. OTHERWISE, I MAY OR MAY NOT LEAK ANOTHER CLUE OF MY IDENTITY.

EVEN THE EXPLOIT ITSELF COULD BE A TASTY FOOD FOR THE RESEARCHERS.\n\nQ: ANYTHING ABOUT SECURITY TEAMS?\nA: IT'S FUN FOR ME WATHCING THE EMERGENCY RESPONSES FROM TOP TIER SECURITY TEAMS (ONLY IN BLOCKCHAIN OF COURSE).\n\n_NOTICE: THE FOLLOWING TIMELINE COULD BE WRONG!_\n\nAT THE BEGINNING, MOST EXPERTS WERE TALKING ABOUT THE SINGLE KEEPER OF THE INSIDER CONSPIRACY.  BASED ON WHAT I HAVE SEEN, @kelvinfichter WAS THE FIRST GUY POINTING OUT THE MOST CRUCIAL BUT OBVIOUS BUG ABOUT THE ETH CONTRACT. (I GOT YOUR ENCRYPTED INQUIRY ;) ) THEN THE SLOW MIST TEAM GOT EXCITED ABOUT THE BAIT AND ANNOUNCED THE GOOD NEWS ABOUT THE TRACES. DIDN'T THEY THINK IT'S TOO OBVIOUS SINCE THE SOURCE OF MY FUNDING WAS ALREADY LABELED \"HOO\"? ANY WAY, THEY TOOK THE RESPONSIBILITY TO LET THE COMMUNITY CALM DOWN. IT'S AN UNEXPECTED SIDE EFFECT, BUT IT'S VERY IMPORTANT. LATER THEY SEEMED BUSY HANLDING INQUIRIES AND DOUBTS FROM THE MEDIA AND THE COMMUNITY. I AM VERY HAPPY THAT THEY ARE HELPING ME TO FINISH THE GUIDING OR EDUCATION PART. THE DARK KNIGHT FINDS HIS HARVEY DENT! THANK YOU, THE SLOW MIST TEAM. THE OTHER SECURITY TEAMS DID NOT SEEM AS ACTIVE AS THE SLOW MIST, BUT THEY CONTRIBUTED TO EXPLAINING MORE DETAILS OF THE EXPLOIT. I THINK CERTIK WAS THE FIRST TO PUBLISH THE MISSING PART ABOUT THE ONTOLOGY INVOCATION. PECKSHIELD ALSO MENTIONED ABOUT THE KICKING OFF TRANSACTION AND THE SPECIAL SIGNER. KUDOS!\n\nQ: ANYTHING ABOUT THE DEFI/BLOCKCHAIN SECURITY?\n\nTHE SECURITY IS A TOUGH JOB, NO MATTER IF IT'S IN CLASSIC OR CRYPTO WORLD. IN MOST CASES, WE SECURITY EXPERTS ARE ONLY SUMMONED AS THE MEDICAL EXAMINERS AFTER THE INCIDENTS. WHAT WE DO IS JUST WRITING POSTMORTEMS, SOMETIMES TRACING THE BAD GUYS. IT'S ALMOST THE SAME IN THE CRYPTO WORLD, EXCEPT THAT SOME PROJECT ARE NOT VERY URGENT GETTING THE MONEY BACK SINCE IT'S NOT THEIR MONEY, THEY WOULD JUST TELL THE REAL VICTIMS THAT \"SORRY WE TRIED BUT NEVER GURANTEED THE EXTREME SECURITY\".\n\nANOTHER FUNNY FACT IS THAT IT'S UNUSUAL TO SEE ANY PROFESSIONAL SECURITY TEAMS REPORT THOSE CRUCIAL BUGS OF LIVE CONTRACTS! SURE, THEY CAN ALWAYS TEACH YOU WHY YOU WERE KILLED AFTER YOUR DEATH! WHY DON'T YOU SEE ANY CASES THAT THE SECURITY TEAMS SPOT THE VULNERABILITY THAT AFFECTS MILLIONS USD, LET ALONE CASES IN BILLIONS? BECAUSE THEY ARE NOT PAID?

You mentioned the most concern is the decentralization of the whole system. Decentralization is a quite flexible standard that requires more precise criteria. How do you define decentralization under certain circumstances? Do you truly have the faith in decentraliztion?  (by the way, to be honest, people can hardly define more popular smart contract blockchains are true decentralized except Ethereum.)   \r\n2. Private Key Safety\r\nIs there any chance you may lose your two keys? What would you suggest users safely guard their private key? \r\n3. The Address\r\nI personally think this address should keep alive. This is already a remarkable event in DeFi history and all participants have the obligation to put this memorable address into good use since everything sent from this address implies a big gesture. Hopefully this story ends up well, but what's next? It should contain its unique vitality and keep sending messages to enlighten successors. You may think about it.\r\n4. Really curious about your response. Be flattered or just think they are Kitsch? \r\n5. Are you a fan of Jason Statham?

If we can figure out a way to move forward together, this could turn into a unique experiment for the industry. We think the first step in this collaboration can be to use the previously mentioned 160 ETH Bounty as a safety fund, managed using an address attributed to you (e.g. 0xA87fB85A93Ca072Cd4e5F0D4f178Bc831Df8a00B ?) to reward those who make outstanding contributions to the industry's security in the future.\r\n\r\nBlockchain is a whole new world, but in a short time span has made itself relevant to many people's lives. Since this incident first occurred, our team has been working around the clock to restore normal operations to Poly Network as soon as possible. There are many projects and users using Poly Network services and we want to minimize the impact on them. Hence, a secure method to swiftly restore our network is currently our top priority. The assets in Poly Network do not belong to us, but to the users, and we have felt the panic of many users who are concerned about the loss of asset rights. We hope you can provide us with your private key to help us restore the assets of affected users as soon as possible and alleviate the panic.\r\n\r\nWe as a group also have our own beliefs and ideas about blockchain, which is why we launched Poly Network. We firmly believe that blockchain isn't just limited to being a new technology, but also a fresh concept and a whole new method of collaboration. We hope Poly Network can become a part of the Web 3.0 infrastructure and facilitate interoperability for different ledgers in the future blockchain world. Before this incident, we decided to upgrade Poly Network to a completely decentralized network, which will be a major upgrade on Poly Network after about two months. Here's a link to the code-  https://github.com/polynetwork/Zion. In this new upgrade, we have worked on a new network consensus mechanism, the protocol architecture and the token economy model. We planned on announcing this on August 18 2021, the first anniversary of Poly Network's mainnnet launch, and were prepared for the entire campaign. So, you can rest assured that we are, in fact, moving towards a common goal.\r\n\r\nPoly Network is a complex system. Interoperability between heterogeneous chains is a new venture, and we need time in order to finish up the new upgrade. After this upgrade goes live, the new Poly Network will operate in a decentralized fashion. We understand your concerns, and so we propose modifying the privileges to a multisignature mechanism for relay chain verifiers that would finally determine the upgrade.\r\n\r\nNo good protocol is built overnight, and we built Poly Network with the goal of building a protocol that belongs to everyone. That is the philosophy with which we entered this blockchain world in the first place. So we encourage more people that share our vision to join us, and we very much hope you will participate in the decentralization process of Poly Network and contribute to protocol security by playing an important role within Poly Network in the future.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the current version of Poly Network is not perfect from a decentralization point of view, but we hope you understand our plans for the project, and the anxiety on part of the users. We believe that after we leave this incident behind, you can join the Poly Network team to discuss future upgrade plans, not just from a security perspective, but also weighing in on more aspects so that we can make Poly Network a better, secure, and more open system together.\r\n\r\nPoly Network Team", "blockHash": "0x4d40dde5d5a94d564f38663b6e346de4643c557e9090f06fc968a933bbae1e72", "blockNumber": 13047861}, {"hash": "0x3598218cba95e97d805eeaead681ec11738245ee9d3b4d99162419b6b74f3042", "timestamp": 1629289009, "address": "0xC8a65Fadf0e0dDAf421F28FEAb69Bf6E2E589963", "message": "DEAR POLY,\nGLAD TO SEE THAT YOU ARE MOVING THINGS TO THE RIGHT DIRECTION!

THEY BUILD THINGS CARELESSLY, BUT THEY CAN FIX THEM QUICKLY. THEY ARE GOOD AT BARGAIN AND BOASTING. THEY KNOW HOW TO TREAT AND HOW TO TRICK. THEY CAN DESIGN SOPHISTICATED CRYPTO PROTOCOLS BUT THEY DON'T KNOW HOW TO APPLY THE SKILL IN REAL WORLD.\n\nI HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COOPERATE WITH THEM THROUGH ETHEREUM WHICH SHOULD BE EFFICIENT AND ELEGANT, BUT IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE AS I EXPECTED. IT TOOK HOURS TO SETUP THE ENCRYPTED CHANNEL FOR INITIAL COMMUNICATION. SINCE THE CHANNEL IS ONLY FOR VULNERABILITY DISCLOSURE, I WILL DECRYPT ALL THE MESSAGES HERE FOR TRANSPARENCY. (SEE THE APPENDIX). NO MORE ENCRYPTION FROM NOW ON.\n\nI JUST WANT TO MAKE THE IT _PERFECT_, SO I _REALLY CARE_ ABOUT RETURNING THE LOCKED USDT. I CAN UNDERSTAND THOSE CHINESE GUYS ARE AFRAID OF BEING SCAMMED, SO I SUGGESTED THAT I CAN RETURN MUCH MORE MONEY THAN THE LOCKED USDT SO THAT THEY WON'T LOSE MORE FOR SURE. THEN I STARTED TRANSFERING EVERYTHING IN BSC & MATIC. HOWEVER, I FELT THAT MY GOODWILL WAS IGNORED COMPLETELY. THEY WERE JUST SITTING THERE AND PUSHING ME. MAYBE THEY WERE TOO NERVOUS UNDER THE PRESSURE FROM THE COMMUNITY. I REALIZED THAT THERE WAS A BETTER WAY TO GET THEM OUT OF THE TROUBLE QUICKLY WHILE KEEPING MY DIGNITY, SO I PROPOSED BUILDING A SHARED MULTISIG WALLET. THAT'S A STRONG PROMISE THAT I WILL NOT BE ABLE TO DO ANYTHING RANDOM TO HURT ANYBODY. --I WAS SURPRISED THAT THEY HAD TROUBLE UNDERSTANDING THE MEANING OF THE SHARED WALLET AND IGNORED MY PROPOSAL FOR HOURS.-- (IT WAS MY FAULT THAT I MISSED THE CORRESPONDING RESPONSE. I DIDN'T NOTICE THAT UNTIL REVIEWING THE CHAT HISTORY TODAY) SOON THEY TRIED TO BRIBE ME WITH THEIR LIMITED BUDGET, WHAT A HILARIOUS SCENE! DID I LOOK LIKE SOME RANSOM GANGSTER? DEAR CHINESE BUSINESSMAN, MONEY IS NOT THE ONLY THING THAT MATTERS.\n\nTHE RESPONSE OF THE USDT ISSUE WAS AMBIGUOUS. IT WOULD BE MUCH MORE REASONABLE IF THEY HAD FIXED THE PROBLEM WHILE I WAS RETURNING OTHER ASSETS. NOW UNLOCKING USDT SEEMS RISKY GIVEN THAT THEY ARE THE WINNER WHO SUCCESSFULLY TRICKED THE BAD GUY TO RETURN EVERYTHING. I AM A LITTLE BIT UPSET ABOUT THEIR HYPOCRISY AND INCOMPETENCY, BECAUSE IT'S NEVER HARD TO SOLVE THE TRUSTING ISSUE AS CRYPTO ENTHUSIASTS: I CAN APPROVE THE TRANSACTION OF MY USDT FROM ANY ACCOUNT, WHICH IS A FEATURE OF THE ERC20 TOKENS, THEN THEY CAN DO THE UNBLACKLIST AND TRANSFER IT IN A SINGLE TRANSACTION OF SMART CONTRACT. IT'S A NEAT SOLUTION TO PROVE THAT ALL ASSETS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERED TO THE SECURED WALLET.\n\nMAYBE THE POLY IS REALLY BUSY WORKING ON THE REPAIRING (AND THEY DID IT REALLY FAST). THOUGH THEY ARE JUDGING ME BASED ON THEIR HYPOTHESIS, I STAY OPEN AND HONEST ABOUT THIS INCIDENT, ANSWERING THE RANDOM QUESTIONS TO ALLEVIATE THE DISTRUST. HERE IS THE MOST WEIRD THING: THE HUGE CROWD OF CHINESE REFUGEES ARE GONE! THEY DON'T EVEN SHOW UP IN THE MESSAGE LIST OF THE MULTISIG WALLET! IT'S REALLY A STRANGE FEELING SINCE I WAS PREPARING FOR COVERING THE UNEXPECTED LOSS OF THOSE GUYS AND WAITING FOR THEIR CLAIMS AND IDEAS ABOUT THIS PROJECT. BUT THE POLY TEAM TOLD ME THAT THERE WERE THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE WHO WERE STILL WORRYING ABOUT THE POTENTIAL LOSS. NOW I BECOME A REAL JOKER: DOING GOOD THINGS IN MY OWN WAY BUT BEING HUMILIATED BY THE CROWD.\n\nI AM KIND OF CONFUSED ABOUT WHAT A MORAL LEADER SHOULD DO, PERHAPS I SHOULD NOT HAVE TAKEN IT SERIOUSLY. ANYWAY, THINGS ARE GETTING BETTER. THE REPAIRING IS SUPRISINGLY FAST. I AM MORE THAN HAPPY TO SEE THE RETURNED STABLE COINS FUNCTIONING IN THE CROSS CHAIN BRIDGE. AND I AGREE THAT THE LIQUIDITY PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN THE RECOVERING PHASE. I AM NOT READY TO PUBLISH THE FINAL KEY IN THIS WEEK THOUGH, I CAN PROVIDE ENOUGH LIQUIDITY OF WBTC & ETH TO START THE ENGINE.

Our Chinese defi projects usually have some common unspoken rules, when they build things, they will review the codes very carefully and invite audits company\u2019s do the auditing multiple times to prevent potential attacks from outside, but they are always so confident they would leave super authorities for themselves, maybe convenient for upgrades and for security safety reasons, subjectively They preclude the possibility of themselves being the victimizer. So, you see the super owner account and you feel strange why it\u2019s so centralized and still so many people willing to invest in it. Actually, it works for most of our Chinese. When we seek for defi projects, we would basically do the research of the background of this project other than read the codes because we are not capable of reading codes, some of us even don\u2019t know how to send transaction. In your world, you only trust codes, but for us we are more inclined to trust people. Wow, this project is endorsed by so many famous institutions, then yolo!!!!LOL. I know we were idiots and really learned a lesson from you. 2.the attitude of polyon your position, you may think Poly tricked you to some extent and only pushed you for returning the assets, even bribed you. It is funny, but maybe its not true. What poly did at first piss off our Chinese community a lot, they didn\u2019t get what your intention and more importantly poor communication skill caused the mistrust and misunderstands. About the locked USDT, they just own you an explanation, from what I know, it is not the process you think. \u201cFrozen funds will be released back to the legitimate owner once there is confirmation / proof of proper actions taken in order to restore security of the bridges.\u201d The CTO of Tether stated on his twitter. It is the normal process tether dealing with the frozen funds. I have to admit Their communication skills really suck, they didn\u2019t even show up to comfort their users when this event occurred, just released some fixing updates with their cold words in the first few days. But in latest two letter they wrote to you, we can see the sincereness and gratitude, I don\u2019t think it is a bribery or something to offer you the bounty. In our Chinese culture, when someone did something good for us, we usually would give him a red pocket to express gratitude, just a gesture of goodwill. LOL. In a word, poly incompetent and inefficient communications lead to all these misunderstandings and mistrusts which make you think they trick you.3. THE HUGE CROWD OF CHINESE REFUGEES ARE GONE! We are here!!!I left you a few messages before maybe you missed it. We have a WeChat group of 500 people named O3 SURVIVORS (PREVIOUS NAME O3 VICTIMS, LOL YOU SAVEd US, You built the NOAH\u2019S ARK) . We talk about you every day, waiting for the todays\u2019 little essay, it is a really unforgettable experience for us either. We were terrified at first, it\u2019s like everything is gone, our lives\u2019 been ruined. when we got to know your real intentions, we were really appreciating what you did for us. Most of us are poor in English, much more shitter English than you. LOL. And we wanted to leave space to you and poly team, scary of too many messages would occupy your time and make things more difficult. We are the jokers not you we bet our live savings to something we didn\u2019t know without doing research.4.The assets recovery problemThey still just own you an explanation. You\u2019ve urged them to start the refund process for several times, they did nothing but push you to return the remaining assets, our community were all annoyed at first. Then I contacted the o3 admin, he said, \u201cone problem is that for cross chain pools we allow users to cash out in busd, usdt or husd even if they deposited something else so if not all funds are returned doing a partial return could result in people draining the pool and people who were slow can't withdraw\u201d. And that would cause more problems and panic. There is no single asset which is full enough to be capable to be withdrawn. You returned the dai back yesterday, I think the USDC pool could be resumed soon. Hope we can see some progress in the following days. Poly team is really poor in communication skills.Hope you are doing well, our Chinese communities are all rooting for you. I\u2019ve noticed you have transferred the bounty to the shared wallet as a compensation for us. We really appreciate for what you did for us. In my opinion, from my personal part I don\u2019t deserve the compensation, all I need is a lesson. Fortunately, the lesson is free, just consume a little energy and emotions. Thank you very much. At least , you guided me, so the guiding part is not meaningless. ----from a fan from Chinese community", "blockHash": "0x98341c2b8dfeb4d8b4a275aaa1a3c26e618ff9533cd851dcce71a0baa6497f76", "blockNumber": 13059375}, {"hash": "0xf2dd31e4930a84b59dcb2b6954f51ff5dc2d91dc874396d5a5bd2229728a82aa", "timestamp": 1629428412, "address": "0xA424293B50D4EaAD913FDdF3AA914dfCb5D01ef4", "message": "Hi,bro.Ihavebeenbusythesedays,thankyouforyourreply.IthinkIunderstandyoursituationverywell.IfIhave100ETH,Iwilldefinitelydonatetosupportyouandsupportyourpositionanddecision,butIdon\u2019thaveone,soI\u2019msorry...Nowitseemsthatmoneyisstillveryimportant.Stillsupportyou!", "blockHash": "0x04494cc1d6bf55ab16eca048431bcc57c8ea7f9f53161ea9cc387c7afdc5f5a4", "blockNumber": 13059609}, {"hash": "0x8c728a303dc82b32c9e2ae1e8c2ce4a055320839be12ace158f30314148b7708", "timestamp": 1629433741, "address": "0x6acE891a8b1CDCeEA6215C39382157a2c9b5227a", "message": "Hello,Mr.White Hat,\n\nI think these are the reasons why our Chinese refugees didnt show up in the message list:\n\nmost of us don't know how to send msg with a transaction.\nsome of us aren't good at English like me.\nmost of us aren't a technical guy and haven't deep understanding of crypto or decentralization.i think this part of us doesnt have much to say or maybe just \"would u pls return the assets\" or something like that.\n\nBut we did have put pressure on the team of poly and O3(build on poly,lost 300m+) in their wechat and tg groups.so at least poly was right about their users feelings.someone lose their temper and i am glad that those guys haven't send you msg  :)\n\nMy personal views, i do think u have saved my ass from other greedy hacker,and poly should do things follow what you said.For poly team,they suck,i will withdraw all my assets after the cosschain function resume.but i still don't think they deserve a complete failure for their project.hope that they can do better after this event.\n\nHave a nice day,\nA Chinese refugee(not a real one,i know:))", "blockHash": "0x9b4a124943abb147f3760a6140a02d2b3fc006e776e7aeb71f531a1f0e5b6865", "blockNumber": 13060009}, {"hash": "0x150188831023de462c4620fbb93a915612455b6c10d7bf376d7acff11275f970", "timestamp": 1629448486, "address": "0x79167bE4daC649f7cc3656463Fd99C468d00238C", "message": "\u001b[2m(unintelligible)\u001b[0m", "blockHash": "0x8d0f5d9817cf6d15301947fbe7b4b580842f9b7fb06030837050cf94ca4e438a", "blockNumber": 13061078}, {"hash": "0x647e215ad62773fd1b16b663b59c5069ebe9b9138be6b53a683dd7681693b159", "timestamp": 1629449006, "address": "0x79167bE4daC649f7cc3656463Fd99C468d00238C", "message": "GOOD NEWS!
